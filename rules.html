        <p class="mt-4">We pride ourselves in providing a safe and dry environment where friends and families from our
          community can get together and have a good time participating in recreational events at a reasonable cost. Our
          fields are completely enclosed. As such, it is required that our guests adhere to the following basic safety
          rules as a minimum:</p>
        <ol class="mt-4">
          <li>NO outdoor cleats are allowed on the fields.</li>

              <li>SHIN GUARDS ARE REQUIRED!</li>
              <li>Non-member, non-rostered individuals are not allowed in the bench areas or on the field during
                gameplay. An up-to-date, signed waiver is also required to be in the bench areas or on the field
                during gameplay.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="all_leagues" class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl">All Soccer Leagues Rules</h3>

        <p class="mt-4">These rules take precedence over the
          &quot;<a href="https://usindoor.com/wp-content/uploads/rulesummary.pdf">Official Rules of Indoor Soccer</a>&quot;
          published by the <a href="https://usindoor.com/">USIndoor Sports Association</a>.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Please email <a href="mailto:info@bremertonsports.com">info@bremertonsports.com</a> with
          any questions or concerns about our rules.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">The Players</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>Unless otherwise stated, leagues will play 5v5 plus a keeper for a total of 6 players on the
            field per team during each game.</li>
          <li>A minimum number of 4 total players must be on the field at all times (including keeper)</li>
          <li>Coed Leagues are required to have a minimum of 2 female FIELD players on the field at all times. Female
            players may sub for male players, but the minimum number must be met for a full team fielded. (If a team
            only has 1 female player on the field, they will have to play shorthanded.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 id="all_leagues_subs" class="text-large sm:text-xl mt-5">Substitute Players (Subs)</h5>

        <p class="mt-4">A substitute player (sub) is a player who is not rostered on the team they would like play for,
          but has received permission from the team to play for the team temporarily for a given game. Prior to the sub
          playing, a sub must obtain a "sub slip" from guest services for <em>each</em> game they plan on playing in
          (<a href="/soccer#adult_pricing">fee(s) may apply</a>). The sub slip for each game must be provided by
          the sub to the referee of the game they plan on playing in <em>before</em> that player steps foot on the
          field.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">A sub slip may only be obtained by a player who does not have an outstanding account balance
          owed to the facility and whose membership is current and in good standing. A sub slip will not be issued to a
          player is currently suspended or not allowed back in the facility (e.g.: a player who is serving a
          <a href="#suspensions_and_ejections">Red Card suspension</a>).</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Equipment</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>Shin guards are required for all play. A warning will be given, and if a player is still caught playing
            without shin guards, they will be given a blue card and the team with the offending player will be down a
            field player for 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>No dangerous objects may be worn (e.g.: hard casts without padding, jewelry, watches, or other objects
            that could injure).</li>
          <li>Bracelets, watches, or Fitbits may be worn if covered by a sweat band. (Sweat bands may be purchased at
            Guest Services.)</li>
          <li>Cleats are not allowed on ANY of our playing surfaces at any time. Turf shoes, Tennis shoes, and indoor
            shoes only. Socks are also required.</li>
          <li>This applies to ALL field play. Anyone wearing cleats in a league game will be blue carded and given
            a 2-minute time penalty.</li>
          <li>Any rental with players wearing cleats will have their rental stopped until all players remove their
            cleats. Lost time will not be refunded.</li>
          <li>Any player entering into a game in violation of these rules will be called for a foul and the other team
            will be presented with a free kick.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Duration of the Game</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>For adult leagues, games will consist of two 22.5-minute halves unless otherwise noted (e.g.: tournament
            play).</li>
          <li>For youth leagues, games will consist of two 20-minute halves unless otherwise noted (e.g.: tournament
            play).</li>
          <li>Games WILL start at their scheduled time.</li>
          <li>Teams who do not have enough players (4 minimum players needed to play) when the clock starts, will have
            5-minutes to get another player and not be charged a late fee.</li>
          <li>Unless otherwise noted, games on the small field will consist of two, 20-minute halves or four 10-minute
            quarters.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Forfeiting</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>Teams who desire to forfeit their upcoming game, must notify the facility as soon as possible (by calling
            or emailing <a href="mailto:info@bremertonsports.com">info@bremertonsports.com</a>) so the facility
            may notify the other team as quickly and early as possible.</li>
          <li>Regardless of when the facility is notified, the team manager on the forfeiting team roster will be fined
            the <em>cost of a game in that session</em> to divide amongst their team as they see fit.</li>
          <li>The team that did not forfeit will be credited the <em>cost of a game in that session</em>.</li>
          <li>A game is considered LATE and not a FORFEIT if a team that did not have enough players when the clock
            started, gets the minimum required amount of players 5 or more minutes from the clock starting.</li>
          <li>A game is considered a FORFEIT if a team does not have enough players after 10 minutes has passed from the
            clock starting. If a game is considered a FORFEIT, the referee will then call the game as such, record which
            team forfeited, then set the clock for the remaining time that the team that was forfeited against can then
            use for the remaining time if they would still like to play. The referee is not required to be down on the
            field in this instance but can be requested to stay if the teams would like to split up and play.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Fouls</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>You may not go to the ground with any part of the body in order to play the ball.</li>
          <li>No sliding, no sliding kicks, no sliding blocks, no playing the ball while on the ground.</li>
          <li>If, in the opinion of the referee, you could not play the ball without going to ground, a foul will be
            called.</li>
          <li>ANY SLIDE TACKLE WILL RESULT IN AN AUTOMATIC BLUE CARD (2-MINUTE PENALTY)!</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Free Kicks</h4>

        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>All free kicks on the large fields are direct, all free kicks on the small field are indirect.</li>
          <li>In youth leagues 11 years old and below, the opposing players must retreat to the attacking line for goal
            box restarts on both fields.</li>
          <li>Penalty Kicks will be taken at the top of the arch with all other players behind the attacking line.
            Penalty kicks will be given if either or both:
            <ul>
              <li>A foul in the box is committed by the last defender.</li>
              <li>A foul in the box is committed that warrants a time penalty.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>All other fouls in the box will be a free kick at the top of the arch with a wall allowed.</li>
          <li>All opponents must be 15 feet from the ball on all restarts.</li>
          <li>On keeper restarts or free kicks in the defensive arch, the opposing team must be 15 feet away from the
            arch until the ball is in play.
            <ul>
              <li>A player intentionally blocking the keeper from distributing the ball from inside of 15 feet will be
                issued a Blue Card.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Violations of the three-line rule will restart anywhere on the opposite third line.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Intimidation Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">The intimidation rule is intended to decrease the chances of players getting struck by the ball
          unnecessarily. This rule applies to only Women's C and all Coed C and D levels.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">There are three parts to the intimidation rule:</p>
        <ol class="mt-4">
          <li>Part 1: Was the ball SHOT with force towards another player?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes?: Continue to Part 2.</li>
              <li>No?: No intimidation rule violation.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Part 2: Did the ball strike another player in the head?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes?: Call a foul on the player that struck the ball and issue a blue card for a 2-minute penalty.</li>
              <li>No?: Continue to Part 3.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Part 3: Did the ball strike another player above the waist but not in the head?
            <ul>
              <li>Yes?: Give a free kick to the team of the player struck and warn the player that kicked the ball
                that another offense by them will result in a blue card.</li>
              <li>No?: Play on.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Mercy Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">When a team gains a goal differential of +5 goals, the opposing team will be allowed to add one
          field player until the goal differential is +4 goals or less. If a time penalty is given to a team playing
          with an extra player, they will need to take the additional field player off. If the goal differential drops
          below 5, the time penalty must still be served in full unless another goal is scored by the opponent (meaning
          another player must be removed).</p>
        <p class="mt-4">In coed leagues, the player taken off must still meet with the 2 female field player
          minimum.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Cards</h4>

        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Blue Cards</strong> are for serious or persistent violations of the rules.</p>
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Yellow Cards</strong> are a warning that the next card displayed will be red.</p>
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Red Cards</strong> are disqualification from the game.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Time Penalties</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">A 2-minute time penalty will be given for Blue Card offenses.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must serve their own time penalties.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">A player receiving 2 Blue Cards will be shown a Yellow Card, notifying them that their next card
          will be red.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">If a player receives an accumulation Red Card (three Blue Cards in one game) the player is
          ejected and the team will have a 2 minute time penalty.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Any player that receives a straight Red Card will be ejected from the game and the team will
          serve a 5-minute time penalty in full regardless of whether or not the other team scores.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">There will be no delayed penalties. If a situation warrants a time penalty, the referee will
          give it at that moment regardless of an advantage situation.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Goal Keepers</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must release a Keeper Restart outside of the arch for play to begin.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Keepers will have 5 seconds to put the ball in play outside of the arch on any stoppages.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Keepers will have a 5 second limit on ANY possession inside the arch whether with the foot or
          hand. Failure to get the ball out of the box in 5 seconds will result in a free kick for the opponents at the
          top of the arch.</p>

        <h4 id="suspensions_and_ejections" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Suspensions and Ejections</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Any player receiving a Red Card is required to leave the facility immediately.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Red Cards will be assessed a <em>mandatory</em> 2-week suspension from all play at the
          facility.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">All Red Cards will be reviewed by management and additional fines and/or suspension time will be
          added within 5 days of the incident.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Fighting and trying to instigate a fight will not be tolerated and will carry heavy suspensions
          and fines.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Suspended players and their team's manager are always notified via email with the administered
          amount of suspension time. The suspended player may not return to the facility until the suspension is fully
          served. Any fines administered to a player must be paid before that player may play again.</p>

          coach getting ejected, they can be replaced by another coach or parent with an ACTIVE Membership with
          Bremerton Sports Center so that the game may resume. If there is no such person, the game will end regardless
          of the amount of time left, and the score will be recorded as is when it is called.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Safety</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Headers are not permitted for ages 4-11 years old. A free kick will be called. Due to this, goal keepers from
          8-11 years old will not be allowed to drop kick the ball, it must be thrown or rolled with the hands. In the
          event of a combined league, the oldest age group league rules will be in play.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Mercy Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">
          When a team gains a goal differential of +4 goals, the team that is down will be allowed to add (1) field
          player until the goal differential is +3 or less. If the goal differential reaches +8 goals, the team that is
          ahead will be forced to remove (1) field player until the goal differential reaches +7 or less. If a time
          penalty is given to a team playing with an extra player, they will need to take the additional field player
          off. If the goal differential drops below 5, the time penalty must still be served in full unless another goal
          is scored by the opponent (meaning another player must be removed).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          This applies to ALL Youth Leagues (Co-Ed High School is considered a Youth League).
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Field 3's 6 Foot Line</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Players are not allowed to stand inside the space from the goal line to the 6' line acting as a
          “goalkeeper”. If a player standing in this area touches the ball, a foul will be called, and the ball will be
          placed at the top of the arch. If a foul is called and the ball is brought back to the top of the arch, the
          defending team can have players stand on the 6' line, but they cannot stand inside the space between the 6'
          line and the goal line. Players are allowed to move through the area to defend the ball as long as they are
          continuously moving in and out of the space.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">The Human Wall</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">
          If a foul is called that results in the defending team placing a human defensive wall, the attacking team is
          not allowed to hit the human defensive wall. If the attacking team happens to hit the human defensive wall,
          the ball will be turned over to the defending team and play will restart from where the human wall was hit.</p>
