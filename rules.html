        <h3 id="adult_league" class="text-2xl sm:text-3xl">Adult Soccer League Rules</h3>

        <p class="mt-4">Bremerton Sports Center uses the
          &quot;<a href="https://usindoor.com/wp-content/uploads/rulesummary.pdf">Official Rules of Indoor Soccer</a>&quot;
          as published by the <a href="https://usindoor.com/">USIndoor Sports Association</a> as the base for our rules of
          play. We extend those base rules with League Rules listed below.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Please email <a href="mailto:leagues@bremertonsports.com">leagues@bremertonsports.com</a> with
          any questions or concerns about our rules.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">The Players</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">All leagues will play 5-v-5 plus a keeper for a total of 6 players on the field per team during
          each game. Coed Leagues will be required to have a minimum of 2 female field players at all times.</p>

        <h5 id="adult_league_subs" class="text-large sm:text-xl mt-5">Substitute Players (Subs)</h5>

        <p class="mt-4">A substitute player (sub) is a player who is not rostered on the team they would like play for,
          but has received permission from the team to play for the team temporarily for a given game. Prior to the sub
          playing, a sub must obtain a "sub slip" from guest services for <em>each</em> game they plan on playing in
          (<a href="/soccer#adult_pricing">fee(s) may apply</a>). The sub slip for each game must be provided by
          the sub to the referee of the game they plan on playing in <em>before</em> that player steps foot on the
          field.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">A sub slip may only be obtained by a player who does not have an outstanding account balance
          owed to the facility and whose membership is current and in good standing. A sub slip will not be issued to a
          player is currently suspended or not allowed back in the facility (e.g.: a player who is serving a
          <a href="#suspensions_and_ejections">Red Card suspension</a>).</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Equipment</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Shinguards are required for all play.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">No dangerous objects (hard casts without padding, jewelry, watches or other objects that could
          injure). This includes fitbits and fitness watches. (These may be worn under a wrist band). If you don't have
          a wrist band and want to wear your watch/fitness tracker, you will be able to purchase a wrist band at Guest
          Services.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Cleats are not allowed on our indoor playing surfaces. Turf shoes, tennis shoes, and indoor
          shoes only.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Duration of the Game</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Games on the large fields consist of two, 22.5 minute halves. Field 1 will kick off on the hour, Field 2 on
          the 1/4 hour.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Free Kicks</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Penalty Kicks will be taken at the top of the arch with all other players behind the attacking
          line. Penalty kicks will be given if:</p>
        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>A foul in the box is committed by the last defender.</li>
          <li>A foul in the box is committed that warrants a time penalty.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">All other fouls in the box will be a free kick at the top of the arch with a wall allowed.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">All opponents must be 15 feet from the ball on all restarts.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">On keeper restarts or free kicks in the defensive arch, the opposing team must be 15 feet away
          from the arch until the ball is in play.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Fouls</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">You may not go to the ground with any part of the body in order to play the ball. No sliding,
          no sliding kicks, and no sliding blocks. If in the opinion of the referee, you could not play the ball without
          going to ground, a foul will be called.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">AN INTENTIONAL SLIDE TACKLE WILL RESULT IN AN AUTOMATIC 2 MINUTE PENALTY.</p>


        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Intimidation Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Note:</strong> this rule applies to only Women's C and all Coed levels.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Any player taking a forceful shot above the waist of any other player and striking OR
          intimidating that player will have a foul called.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Continued use of extreme and uncontrolled force will result in time penalties to the discretion
          of the official.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Mercy Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">When a team falls behind by 5+ goals, they will have the option to add one field player until
          the goal differential is 4 goals or less.  If a time penalty is given to that team, they will take the
          additional field player off. If the goal differential drops below 5, the time penalty must still be served in
          full and an additional player must be removed.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">In Coed Leagues, the player taken off must still meet with the 2 female field player
          minimum.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Cards</h4>

        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Blue Cards</strong> are for serious or persistent violations of the rules.</p>
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Yellow Cards</strong> are a warning that the next card displayed will be red.</p>
        <p class="mt-4"><strong>Red Cards</strong> are disqualification from the game.</p>


        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Time Penalties</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">A 2-minute time penalty will be given for Blue Card offenses.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must serve their own time penalties.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">A player receiving 2 Blue Cards will be shown a Yellow Card, notifying them that their next card
          will be red.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">If a player receives an accumulation Red Card (three Blue Cards in one game) the player is
          ejected and the team will have a 2 minute time penalty.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Any player that receives a straight Red Card will be ejected from the game and the team will
          serve a 5-minute time penalty in full regardless of whether or not the other team scores.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">There will be no delayed penalties. If a situation warrants a time penalty, the referee will
          give it at that moment regardless of an advantage situation.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Goal Keepers</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must release a Keeper Restart outside of the arch for play to begin.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Keepers will have 5 seconds to put the ball in play outside of the arch on any stoppages.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Keepers will have a 5 second limit on ANY possession inside the arch whether with the foot or
          hand. Failure to get the ball out of the box in 5 seconds will result in a free kick for the opponents at the
          top of the arch.</p>

        <h4 id="suspensions_and_ejections" class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Suspensions and Ejections</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Any player receiving a Red Card is required to leave the facility immediately.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Red Cards will be assessed a <em>mandatory</em> 1-week suspension from all play at the
          facility.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">All Red Cards will be reviewed by management and additional fines and/or suspension time will be
          added within 5 days of the incident.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Fighting and trying to instigate a fight will not be tolerated and will carry heavy suspensions
          and fines.</p>
