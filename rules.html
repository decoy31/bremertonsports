          &quot;<a href="https://usindoor.com/wp-content/uploads/rulesummary.pdf">Official Rules of Indoor Soccer</a>&quot;
          as published by the <a href="https://usindoor.com/">USIndoor Sports Association</a> as a base for our rules of

        <p class="mt-4">Games on the large fields consist of two, 22.5 minute halves. Field 1 will kick off on the hour, Field 2 on
          the 1/4 hour.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Free Kicks</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Penalty Kicks will be taken at the top of the arch with all other players behind the attacking
          line. Penalty kicks will be given if:</p>
        <ul class="mt-4">
          <li>A foul in the box is committed by the last defender.</li>

          from the arch until the ball is in play.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Fouls</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">You may not go to the ground with any part of the body in order to play the ball. No sliding,
          no sliding kicks, and no sliding blocks. If in the opinion of the referee, you could not play the ball without
          going to ground, a foul will be called.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Intimidation Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Any player taking a forceful shot above the waist of any other player and striking OR

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Mercy Rule</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">When a team falls behind by 5+ goals, they will have the option to add one field player until
          the goal differential is 4 goals or less.  If a time penalty is given to that team, they will take the
          additional field player off. If the goal differential drops below 5, the time penalty must still be served in
          full and an additional player must be removed.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">In Coed Leagues, the player taken off must still meet with the 2 female field player
          minimum.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must serve their own time penalties.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">A player receiving 2 Blue Cards will be shown a Yellow Card, notifying them that their next card
          will be red.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">If a player receives an accumulation Red Card (three Blue Cards in one game) the player is
          ejected and the team will have a 2 minute time penalty.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Any player that receives a straight Red Card will be ejected from the game and the team will
          serve a 5-minute time penalty in full regardless of whether or not the other team scores.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">There will be no delayed penalties. If a situation warrants a time penalty, the referee will
          give it at that moment regardless of an advantage situation.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Goal Keepers</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Goal keepers must release a Keeper Restart outside of the arch for play to begin.</p>

        <p class="mt-4">Keepers will have a 5 second limit on ANY possession inside the arch whether with the foot or
          hand. Failure to get the ball out of the box in 5 seconds will result in a free kick for the opponents at the
          top of the arch.</p>

        <h4 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl mt-5">Suspensions and Ejections</h4>

        <p class="mt-4">Any player receiving a Red Card is required to leave the facility immediately.</p>
